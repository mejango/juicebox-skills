  Resolve which hooks actually run on pay and cash-out for a Juicebox V6 project by unwrapping
  `ruleset.metadata.dataHook` (REVOwner, JBOmnichainDeployer, JBBuybackHookRegistry, bare
  JB721TiersHook / JBBuybackHook, custom). Use when: (1) quoting a pay or cash-out and the
  ruleset `dataHook` is a wrapper singleton, (2) finding a project's buyback pool or 721 shop,
  (3) deciding whether NFTs price cash-outs, (4) a UI shows the wrong pool / no shop for a
  revnet or omnichain project, (5) building `pay`/`cashOut` metadata for the right hook ID.

# Data hook resolution

`JBRulesetMetadata.dataHook` is rarely the hook that does the work. Revnets and omnichain 721
projects set a singleton wrapper as the data hook and store the real hooks in the wrapper's own
storage. A webclient must unwrap before it can quote weights, route swaps, or find a shop.

## What the terminal does

`JBTerminalStore` calls the data hook only when the flag is set **and** the address is nonzero:

| Flow | Condition | Call | Result used for |
|------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Pay | `useDataHookForPay && dataHook != 0` | `beforePayRecordedWith(ctx) → (weight, JBPayHookSpecification[])` | `weight` replaces `ruleset.weight`; each non-`noop` spec gets `afterPayRecordedWith{value: amount}` from `JBMultiTerminal` |
| Cash out | `useDataHookForCashOut && dataHook != 0` | `beforeCashOutRecordedWith(ctx) → (cashOutTaxRate, effectiveCashOutCount, effectiveTotalSupply, effectiveSurplusValue, JBCashOutHookSpecification[])` | Full override of the bonding curve; `reclaimAmount` capped at local surplus; non-`noop` specs get `afterCashOutRecordedWith` |

Spec structs (ABI order): `(address hook, bool noop, uint256 amount, bytes metadata)`. A spec with
`noop = true` and `amount != 0` reverts `JBTerminalStore_NoopHookSpecHasAmount`.

Metadata packing (`JBRulesetMetadataResolver`): bit 80 `useDataHookForPay`, bit 81
`useDataHookForCashOut`, bits 82–241 `dataHook`.

`JBController` also consults the data hook: `sender == dataHook` or
`dataHook.hasMintPermissionFor(projectId, ruleset, sender)` grants `mintTokensOf` without
`allowOwnerMinting`. Wrappers forward this too (REVOwner → LOANS, registry, suckers;
JBOmnichainDeployer → suckers, extra hook; registry → resolved hook).

## Resolution decision table

All addresses are identical on every chain; read them from `shared/chain-config.json`.

| `dataHook` equals | Identify by | Wraps | Runs on pay | Runs on cash-out |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| `REVOwner` `0x2ba4705ad0332cdfb299b452068438bcba3faaf3` | address match (also ERC-165 `IJBRulesetDataHook` + `IJBCashOutHook`) | `tiered721HookOf(revnetId) → IJB721TiersHook` (zero if none); `BUYBACK_HOOK()` = `JBBuybackHookRegistry` | 721 hook first (its split amount), then `registry.hookOf(id)` with the remainder; specs merged `[721, buyback]` | Buyback hook only (via registry) plus REVOwner's own fee spec; loans/suckers/cash-out delay applied first. 721 hook never prices cash-outs on a revnet |
| `JBOmnichainDeployer` `0xb853758a70a6b4216c09f1d071ea2344aba0a34f` | address match (ERC-165 `IJBOmnichainDeployer`, `IJBRulesetDataHook`) | `tiered721HookOf(projectId, rulesetId) → (hook, useDataHookForCashOut)`; `extraDataHookOf(projectId, rulesetId) → (dataHook, useDataHookForPay, useDataHookForCashOut)` | 721 hook always (when set), then extra hook if its stored `useDataHookForPay`; weight from the extra hook | 721 hook if its stored `useDataHookForCashOut`; otherwise extra hook if its stored `useDataHookForCashOut`. Never both |
| `JBBuybackHookRegistry` `0x72f55a54cd53410a5ff175508a5a384227081788` | address match (ERC-165 `IJBBuybackHookRegistry`) | `hookOf(projectId)`: per-project `setHookFor` pin → `defaultHook` if `projectId > defaultHookProjectIdThreshold` → historical default segment → `address(0)` | resolved buyback hook | resolved buyback hook (registry forwards both) |
| a `JBBuybackHook` (default `0x77bee1ad2ac0ace98a9b5b58d75685c8b4d94948`; any allowed hook) | ERC-165 `IJBBuybackHook` `0x16f0f2dd`, or `registry.isHookAllowed(addr)` | nothing | itself — swaps when the pool beats issuance | itself — routes cash-outs through the pool unless the `cashOut` metadata entry sets `skip`, no pool, or no project token |
| a `JB721TiersHook` clone | ERC-165 `IJB721TiersHook` `0xc74ac2fc`; `JBAddressRegistry.deployerOf(addr) == JB721TiersHookDeployer` | nothing | itself — mints tiers, weight from `pricingContext` | itself, only if the ruleset bit `useDataHookForCashOut` is set |
| `CTDeployer`, `DefifaHook`, unknown | fallthrough | project-specific | treat as opaque custom hook: no buyback pool, no shop unless the address itself answers `STORE()` | same |
| `address(0)` or both flags false | — | — | none | none |

Registry `hookOf` is a **default-returning** getter. Reading it for a project whose data hook is
not the registry or REVOwner yields a hook that never runs. Recognize the ruleset data hook first.

Rekeyed metadata: the registry rewrites the `pay` / `cashOut` metadata entry from its own ID to the
resolved hook's ID (`bytes4(bytes20(hook) ^ bytes20(keccak256("pay")))`). REVOwner forwards the
context to the registry, so for revnets and registry projects encode buyback quotes under the
**registry's** ID; for a bare `JBBuybackHook` encode under the hook's ID.

ERC-165 IDs (computed from declared selectors): `IJBRulesetDataHook` `0xe3472395`,
`IJB721TiersHook` `0xc74ac2fc`, `IJBBuybackHook` `0x16f0f2dd`. `REVDeployer` does **not** report
`IJBRulesetDataHook` — it is never the data hook; `REVOwner` is.

## Production algorithm (juicebox.money `MarketSection.resolveMarket`, revnet.money `resolveBuybackHook`)

1. `JBDirectory.controllerOf(projectId)` — never hardcode the controller.
2. `controller.currentRulesetOf(projectId)` → `(ruleset, metadata)`; `metadata.dataHook == 0` → none.
3. If `dataHook == JBOmnichainDeployer`: replace with `extraDataHookOf(projectId, ruleset.id).dataHook` (buyback path) or `tiered721HookOf(projectId, ruleset.id)` (shop path). One unwrap level.
4. If `dataHook ∈ {JBBuybackHookRegistry, REVOwner}` → `registry.hookOf(projectId)`, zero → none.
5. Else if `dataHook == JBBuybackHook` (config address) → itself.
6. Else → no buyback hook.
7. Pool: `hook.poolKeyOf(projectId, terminalToken)` with the project's first accounting-context token; a zero `PoolKey` means no market.

Shop path (`@bananapus/nana-sdk-core` `getProject721Shop`): revnet → `REVOwner.tiered721HookOf(id)`;
else require `useDataHookForPay` and nonzero `dataHook`; omnichain → `tiered721HookOf`; else the raw
`dataHook`, probed with `STORE()` — a "function does not exist" revert means not a 721 hook.
Cash-out pricing by NFTs: omnichain → the deployer's stored `useDataHookForCashOut` tuple (the ruleset
bit is always `true` there and says nothing); single-chain → the ruleset bit. Neither webclient uses
`supportsInterface`; both classify by address equality against `shared/chain-config.json`.

export async function resolveDataHooks(client: PublicClient, chainId: number, projectId: bigint) {
  const c = (config as any).chains[String(chainId)].contracts as Record<string, Address>
  const eq = (a?: Address, b?: Address) => !!a && !!b && a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()
  const read = (address: Address, functionName: string, args: unknown[]) =>
    client.readContract({ address, abi: ABI, functionName: functionName as any, args: args as any })
  const out = { payHooks: [] as Address[], cashOutHooks: [] as Address[], buyback: null as Address | null, tiers721: null as Address | null }

  const controller = (await read(c.JBDirectory, 'controllerOf', [projectId])) as Address

```

`payHooks` / `cashOutHooks` list the contracts whose `before*RecordedWith` logic decides the quote, in
call order. The terminal itself still calls only `metadata.dataHook`.

## Verifying 721 clones

Every `JB721TiersHook` is a `LibClone` proxy deployed by `JB721TiersHookDeployer`
(`0xb7b8ec35e2dd84afff04ee769c6189e7a4d44a78`), which registers each clone:
`JBAddressRegistry.deployerOf(hook) == JB721TiersHookDeployer`. This holds for clones created via
`JB721TiersHookProjectDeployer`, `JBOmnichainDeployer`, `REVDeployer`, and `CTDeployer` — they all
call the hook deployer. Use it instead of trusting `STORE()` or `supportsInterface` on an unknown
address: a malicious contract can answer both, but cannot register itself under the deployer's
address (`registerAddress` derives the address from the deployer's nonce or salt+bytecode).
Tiers then come from `JB721TiersHookStore.tiersOf(hook, ...)` at
`0x69913acf79dbba170d9efafe605ee62b42164f9c`.

## Common mistakes

- Calling `JBBuybackHookRegistry.hookOf(projectId)` without first checking that the ruleset's data hook is the registry or REVOwner. It returns a default hook for nearly every project; the returned pool never trades for projects that do not route through it.
- Treating `REVDeployer` as the revnet data hook. `REVDeployer` sets `dataHook = OWNER` (REVOwner). Reading `tiered721HookOf` on `REVDeployer` fails; read it on `REVOwner`.
- Using the ruleset bit `useDataHookForCashOut` on an omnichain project. `JBOmnichainDeployer` forces both bits `true`; the stored `tiered721HookOf(...).useDataHookForCashOut` and `extraDataHookOf(...).useDataHookForCashOut` are the only truth.
- Expecting the 721 hook to price a revnet cash-out. `REVOwner.beforeCashOutRecordedWith` never calls the 721 hook; revnet NFTs are pay-only.
- Unwrapping only one of the two omnichain getters. `extraDataHookOf` holds the buyback hook, `tiered721HookOf` holds the shop; a project can have both.
- Encoding a buyback quote under `JBBuybackHook`'s metadata ID for a revnet. REVOwner forwards to the registry, which rekeys from the registry's ID. Use the registry's ID.
- Falling back to a manifest default when recognition fails. Unknown hooks (`CTDeployer`, `DefifaHook`, custom) mean "no buyback, no shop", never "use the default pool".
- Hardcoding `JBController` as the controller. Read `JBDirectory.controllerOf(projectId)`.
