  Revnets should default to omnichain deployment. Use when: (1) a revnet deployment
  targets a single chain without sucker configuration, (2) building deployRevnet
  transactions and deciding chain coverage, (3) an existing revnet needs to expand to a
  new chain, (4) verifying cross-chain config-hash consistency for sucker deployment.

# Revnets Default to Omnichain

Revnets are designed for network effects. Unless the user explicitly asks for single-chain, deploy to all supported chains (Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum — or their sepolias) with suckers bridging the token between them.

## How omnichain revnets work

- `REVDeployer` (same address on every chain: see `shared/chain-config.json`) deploys the revnet independently on each chain via `deployFor(...)`.
- Passing a non-zero `REVSuckerDeploymentConfig.salt` deploys suckers in the same call. Sucker addresses derive from `keccak256(abi.encode(encodedConfigurationHash, suckerConfig.salt, msgSender))` — identical config + salt + sender on each chain produces matching peers.
- The revnet's ERC-20 gets a deterministic address too (salted with `description.salt` + config hash + sender), so the token has the same address on every chain.
- Holders bridge tokens through suckers; sucker cash-outs bypass tax and fees so cross-chain arbitrage equalizes per-chain backing.

## Deployment checklist

- [ ] Deploy on every target chain with the **same** `REVConfig`, `description.salt`, sucker salt, and sender — otherwise `hashedEncodedConfigurationOf` diverges and sucker peers won't match.
- [ ] First-stage timestamp: if the origin chain used `startsAtOrAfter = 0`, the deployer normalized it to that chain's `block.timestamp`. Later-chain deployments must pass that origin timestamp explicitly to reproduce the config hash.
- [ ] Per-chain `accountingContextsToAccept`: ERC-20 addresses differ per chain (e.g. USDC). Use the chain's actual token address in each chain's terminal accounting contexts and sucker token mappings; only the native token sentinel (`0x…EEEe`) is chain-invariant.
- [ ] Per-chain `autoIssuances`: each entry carries a `chainId` and only mints on the matching chain — include the full cross-chain list on every deployment (it is part of the config hash).
- [ ] Deploying an existing revnet onto a new chain (first stage already started) triggers a 7-day cash-out delay (`REVDeployer.CASH_OUT_DELAY = 604_800`) on that chain. Bridging in via suckers stays open during the delay so the new treasury can be primed.
- [ ] Later sucker expansion: only the revnet's operator can call `REVDeployer.deploySuckersFor`, and only if the stage's `extraMetadata` has bit 2 set (allow deploying suckers).

## Verification

For a deployRevnet transaction, check:
- Multiple chains configured (unless single-chain was explicitly requested)
- Non-zero sucker salt with deployer configurations for each peer chain
- Terminal token addresses correct per chain

## Common mistakes

- Reusing one chain's USDC address on every chain — sucker registry or terminal config reverts or silently misroutes.
- Deploying with different senders per chain: the sender is mixed into every salt, so addresses and config hashes stop matching.
- Leaving `startsAtOrAfter = 0` on later-chain deployments of an already-started revnet — the config hash won't reproduce and the 7-day cash-out delay logic keys off the real start time.
