  Omnichain Juicebox projects with 721 hooks deploy separate NFT collections on each
  chain — tier supply is per-chain, not aggregate. Use when: (1) user asks about total
  NFT supply across chains, (2) building UI that displays aggregate supply, (3)
  explaining why supply "multiplies" on multi-chain projects, (4) deciding between
  single-chain and multi-chain NFT deployment.

# Per-Chain 721 Tier Configuration

## The constraint

**NFT tier supply is per-chain, not aggregate.** An omnichain project deploying a 100-copy tier to 3 chains creates 300 mintable NFTs — 100 on each chain.

```
Omnichain project, tier with initialSupply = 100, deployed to 3 chains:
  Ethereum:  100 mintable
  Optimism:  100 mintable
  Base:      100 mintable
  Total:     300 — not 100
```

## Why

Each chain runs its own `JB721TiersHook` instance (deployed per project per chain by `JB721TiersHookDeployer`). Tier data lives in the singleton `JB721TiersHookStore` on that chain, keyed by hook address. There is no cross-chain state sharing: `initialSupply` and `remainingSupply` (`uint32` fields of `JB721Tier`) count only local mints.

Project ERC-20 tokens bridge across chains via suckers to maintain a unified supply. NFTs do not bridge; each chain's collection is independent.

## How omnichain 721 deploys work

`JBOmnichainDeployer.launchProjectFor` / `launchRulesetsFor` / `queueRulesetsOf` (nana-omnichain-deployers-v6) accept a `JBOmnichain721Config`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `deployTiersHookConfig` | `JBDeploy721TiersHookConfig` | Hook name/symbol/tiers/flags |
| `useDataHookForCashOut` | `bool` | Whether NFTs price cash outs |
| `salt` | `bytes32` | Deterministic deployment salt |

The same transaction is relayed to each target chain (e.g. via Relayr). On every chain:

1. A new `JB721TiersHook` instance is deployed with the same tier config.
2. The hook is set as the ruleset's `dataHook` with `useDataHookForPay = true`.
3. Tier IDs, prices, and supplies are identical across chains but completely independent.

Overloads without a `JBOmnichain721Config` deploy a default empty-tier hook (`baseCurrency` from the first ruleset, `decimals = 18`).

## User communication

Say "networks" or "locations", not "chains", when talking to non-technical users:

> "Your reward supply is set per network. 100 copies deployed to 3 networks means 100 available on each — 300 total. For exactly 100 total, either enable rewards on one network only, or split the supply (e.g. 33/33/34)."

## Recommendations by goal

| Goal | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Exactly N NFTs total | Enable the 721 hook on one chain only, or divide `initialSupply` across chains (uneven sell-out risk) |
| Maximum distribution | Accept per-chain supply; every network gets full access |
| Cross-chain scarcity | Hard. Monitor aggregate mints off-chain (Bendystraw) and `adjustTiers` to reduce remaining supply on faster-selling chains, or stay single-chain |

Removing a tier via `adjustTiers` stops new mints on that chain; existing NFTs remain valid.

## Querying supply

### Per chain, on-chain (real-time)

```typescript
// 1. Hook address = the ruleset's dataHook (read via JBController.currentRulesetOf
//    metadata), or a known address from shared/chain-config.json.
// 2. Store is shared: hook.STORE() → JB721TiersHookStore (same address on all chains).
const tiers = await client.readContract({
  address: storeAddress,
  abi: JB721TiersHookStoreAbi, // shared/abis/JB721TiersHookStore.json
  functionName: 'tiersOf',
  args: [hookAddress, [], false, 0n, 100n], // categories, includeResolvedUri, startingId, size
})
// Each JB721Tier: { id, price, remainingSupply, initialSupply, ... }
```

### Aggregate across chains

Sum `remainingSupply` / `initialSupply` per tier ID over every chain's hook. Fetch each chain via RPC, or use Bendystraw for indexed aggregate data (see the `jb-bendystraw` skill). Tier IDs match across chains when deployed from one omnichain config.

### UI pattern

Show the current chain's remaining supply by default; expose a per-chain breakdown plus total on demand:

```
Supply by network
  Ethereum:   45
  Optimism:   67
  Base:       82
  ─────────────
  Total:     194 of 300
```

In deploy previews, label tier supply "per network" and show the multiplication explicitly ("3 networks × 100 supply = 300 total").

## Common mistakes

- **Displaying one chain's `remainingSupply` as the project total.** It is local to that chain's hook.
- **Assuming NFTs bridge like project tokens.** Suckers bridge the ERC-20 supply only; NFT collections are per-chain.
- **Expecting the store to aggregate.** `JB721TiersHookStore` shares an address across chains, but each chain's instance holds only local state.
- **Promising "only 100 will ever exist" on a multi-chain deploy.** True only if the 721 hook is enabled on a single chain.
